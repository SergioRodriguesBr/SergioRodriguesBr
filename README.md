- 👋 Hi, I’m @SergioRodriguesBr
- 👀 I’m interested in .net Core, .Net Framework and all that .Net SDK has to offer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of things. It's hard to list everything here. But the important lesson today is never ever ever sync your github account with microsoft account.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on .net projects in general.
